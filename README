audio file loader - this loads in an audio file - aiff, wav etc - and iterates through the sam,pals, stroing them as a vector in the class AudioFile. This has routines to draw the vector between various points, specified either in milliseconds or in sample frames.

NB this is called ofxSoundFileLoader in the actual project

The add-on uses libsndfile. That probably needs to be compiled (automatically goes in users->local->lib 
i think)


DFEPENDENCIES

AubioFullOSXUni - included

for libsndfile (that reads in samples)
